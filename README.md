## Overview

In Barbarossa, players take turns moving units across a grid representing Eastern Europe and Russia. The game incorporates different terrain types, a Fog of War system where only nearby enemy units are visible, and weather effects that influence combat and movement. The objective is different for each team:
- **Germany:** Capture key Soviet cities before winter sets in or eliminate 80% of Soviet forces.
- **Russia:** Hold Moscow until winter or launch a counteroffensive after winter.

## Features

- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Alternate turns between the two teams.
- **Grid-Based Map:** Move units across a grid with terrain influences.
- **Fog of War:** Only reveal enemy units within your units' line of sight.
- **Weather System:** Dynamic weather changes impact movement and combat (Summer, Fall, Winter).
